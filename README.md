# House_Price_Prediction_ML-Project-13
Predicting house prices can help to determine the selling price of a house of a particular region and can help people to find the right time to buy a home. In this I will introduce you to a machine learning project on house price prediction with Python
In this task on House Price Prediction using machine learning, our task is to use data from the California census to create a machine learning model to predict house prices in the State. The data includes features such as population, median income, and median house prices for each block group in California.
I hope you have understood the above problem statement about predicting the house prices.
